        <h3>My Roller Coaster Ride</h3>
        <p>
          Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, raised in Puerto Rico. I first entered college thinking I
          was going to be an electrical engineer. Three years later I decided to change
          concentration to become an event producer. I did a few events for a couple of years and
          then went into real estate. Once I passed the test to become a real estate agent, the
          agency told me that my license would not come in for at least 6-8 months. During this down
          time I decided to self learn coding on a whim. Needless to say I never sold a single
          estate. Now I’m finishing my Master’s in Software Development at Boston University.

        <h3>My Love for Games</h3>
        <p>
          I found my love for video games early with <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> After that I played
          anything I could put my hands on until I discovered Marvel vs Capcom 2 in high school. In
          my first few years of college the game’s sequel (<a

            target="_blank"
          >
            Marvel vs Capcom 3 </a
          >) came out. I fell so in love with the game that I started playing it competitively going
          to tournaments trying to be the best. Naturally, as I get my degree in Software
          Development, I see myself working for a video game company.
